## What is API Key Management?

Esper offers a complete set of open APIs to empower devs to build, deploy, and manage single-purpose Android experiences for any use case - including restaurant kiosks, retail POS, and smart fitness gear. Our APIs are available to help Android product devs turn repetitive app and device management tasks into reusable code.

You'll need an API key and Enterprise ID to use Esper's Cloud API, Device SDK, Python SDK, and CLI. We also offer a Plugin for the Android Studio. The plugin simplifies app diagnostics from the Android Studio IDE, so you can remotely fine-tune apps deployed to field devices.
