## What is Content Management?

You can upload or transfer file(s) up to 2 GB, including configuration files and other file formats, to devices and device groups. Now, you can:

-   Store files in the Esper Console.
-   View transfer history and status details for specific files to devices or groups.
    

:::tip
When large files are transferred to many devices, the process can take a long time to complete.
