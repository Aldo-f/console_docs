Step 2: To select the groups and/or devices you wish to transfer this file to, choose the appropriate "Groups" or "Devices" tab and click **Link** against the specific device or group. The selected list of devices and/or groups will be displayed on the right pane. You may use the search option to find a particular device or group easily.

Step 3:  Provide the destination file path on the devices. One example of an internal storage path would be /storage/emulated/0/download/.

Once complete, click **Transfer**. 

You can transfer files to internal storage or removable storage device like SD cards. All the removable storage devices will have a unique eight-character ID. You just need to add a prefix "ESPER_EXTERNAL" if the ID is not known.
