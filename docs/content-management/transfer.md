Step 3: You then choose the path on the devices where you want the file to be transferred. Once completed click on **Transfer**. Previously, you could push files to the internal storage of a device. Now, you can push and store the files on a removable storage device like SD cards. All the removable storage devices will have an unique eight-character ID. But you don’t need to worry about the ID. You just need to add "ESPER_EXTERNAL" at the beginning.

Success or fail toast will appear on the bottom left of your console screen once the file transfer has been successfully completed.
