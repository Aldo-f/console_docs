Step 3: Use the slider to set the geofence radius. The geofence is a circle; its radius can be as small as 100 meters and as large as 10 kilometers. GPS can drift and jump, thus a geofence smaller than 100m can cause false positives.

Step 7: If you choose to Lockdown the device, a lock screen will be displayed if the device is taken outside the geofence boundary. If you choose to beep, the device will keep beeping when it goes outside the geofence boundary.
