## How to Add or Modify Company Code Used as Prefix for the Device ID?

You can enter two 3-letter codes called short code in the Company Settings tab. Short codes can be an abbreviation for your company name and location. But, you can also customize these codes. Your short codes become a prefix to the name of all devices you control in Esper.

In this example, ESP is a three-letter abbreviation for our company, Esper. DOC signifies the documentation team.

**Note**: If you change your short code after you’ve provisioned devices, those devices will display the old short code prefix. But, the new short code will be displayed in the Esper Console and used for API, SDK, and CLI calls. It's a best practice to make changes to short code before you provision any devices.

Step 1: Click on your profile icon at the top right corner of the console. Choose ‘Company Settings’ from the drop down.
