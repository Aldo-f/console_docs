## How to Upload Your App to the Esper Cloud? 

When you first enter your Esper Console, there are no apps available. If you want to include your app to have it when you provision your first device, upload it to your Esper Endpoint as an Enterprise App stored in the Esper Cloud. Uploading the App works with both AOSP and GMS devices. Be sure that your APK is signed with the V1 signature, as that’s the signature we check for when apps are uploaded. Upload your app by going to Apps in your left sidebar, and then click the Upload Apps button. Learn more about uploading apps to the Esper Cloud [here.](https://docs.esper.io/home/console.html#apps)

If you're feeling adventurous, upload several versions of your app so you can try out pushing new versions to your device to try out Esper’s app management capabilities.

You can use Google Play apps when you provision a GMS device. You need to create a managed Google Play account.

**Note**: You need to set up an account before Google Play apps are available for approval to be used in your Endpoint and for installation on your provisioned devices.

Go to Apps, and then click Google Play to get started. Find out more about enrolling in managed Google Play [here.](https://docs.esper.io/home/console.html#signing-up-for-play-for-work)

This is an optional step; you don’t have to include any apps when you start—but depending on your use case, you may wish to have your Enterprise App available, a desired Play Store app, or any combination of the two.
