## How to Modify Company Shortcode?

We use a Device Name to reference devices that are provisioned in Esper. They are mapped to a GUID-based Device ID we use at the API level. The Device Name is displayed on the Home screen of provisioned devices (noting it is possible to remove the Device Name for specific use cases).

We create a system-generated Device Name prefix consisting of 6 characters. If you are unhappy with the system-generated prefix, feel free to change it by going to Company Settings on your left sidebar and then click Edit Profile, the company shortcode will be at the bottom. Or you can just go with the default prefix. Find out more about Company Settings and the shortcode [here.](../company-settings/company-code.md)
