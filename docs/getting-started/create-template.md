## How to Create a Provisioning Template?

Now that you have your very own endpoint, the next step is to create a Provisioning Template. A Provisioning Template enables you to define the initial profile for your devices. You can specify the configuration, applications to be loaded, and unique settings you wish to apply. Once youâ€™ve created a template, you can use it to provision as many devices as you need.

To start creating a template, click on the Provisioning Templates link that appears in the left sidebar of your endpoint:

Please read  [steps to create a device template](../provisioning-template/createtemplate.md)  for more information on this process.
