## How to Find Your Device on the Console?

One way to explore and interact with your devices is to use Esper’s Web Console. Once your device is provisioned, you’ll start seeing it on your Console:

Here are some of the exciting things you can try out:

-   Define a Compliance Policy (read more  [here](https://docs.esper.io/home/console.html#compliance-policy)) and then push it out to your device ([here](https://docs.esper.io/home/console.html#compliance-policy-tab)).
    
-   Update an app you installed on your device to a newer version.
    
-   Initiate a remote view (or if supported remote control) session (read more  [here](https://docs.esper.io/home/console.html#remote-viewer-tab)).
    
-   Experiment with a Kiosk mode application (read more  [here](https://docs.esper.io/home/console.html#settings-tab)).
    

Once you get the fundamentals of Esper, you can move on to Esper’s Group management capabilities by provisioning additional devices and putting them into the same group.
