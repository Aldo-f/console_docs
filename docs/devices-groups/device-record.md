How to Create a Device Record?
Navigate to the Devices & Groups section of the Console. Click Add. You can choose ‘Onboard Device’ from the following options: 


Individual Devices
Choose Individual Devices from the options. On the modal, enter the unique identifier for the device you wish to upload. 

You have an option to upload a device to the directory or choose a group/subgroup for the device. These devices can be managed using a Blueprint. If you choose to upload the device to the directory, it will be a part of the unmanaged devices group and the devices need to be moved into a group to manage them using a blueprint. 
Once you select the group/sub-group to onboard the device, enter the optional alias and tags. Click the Review & Add button.


Note : Describe how you can add tags, aliases (+sequence), and a group in advance

Note: You can scan a QR code for a group and onboard the device to it. The device will be added to the selected group with the associated blueprint.



Bulk Upload
This allows you to upload multiple devices at once. You can download a template, fill in the details, and upload the .csv file. Click Done. 

Note: Add csv details
