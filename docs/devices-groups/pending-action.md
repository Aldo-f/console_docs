Click Rename to change the device name.

  

## Reject Device

Rejecting the record will prevent this device from being onboarded to your endpoint. The record will remain in your Directory, however, it will be hidden by default. You will stop receiving prompts to approve this record, but you may approve it at any time to continue onboarding the device.  


  

## Delete Record

Deleting the record will reject approval for onboarding and permanently remove the record from your endpoint. If another attempt is made to onboard this device, you may need to approve or reject the request again.
