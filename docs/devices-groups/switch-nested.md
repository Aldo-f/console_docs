## How to Switch to See Only Immediate Devices Provisioned to a Group?

  

When you select any group from the left pane of the ‘Devices & Groups’ screen, the right pane, displays all the devices provisioned under that parent group. All the devices are provisioned directly to selected groups or devices provisioned under any subgroup are shown.

  

However, you can control to see only the directly provisioned devices and not the other sub-hierarchy devices. Toggle the **Show nested device** to switch on the top right corner to control the hierarchy to immediate or to subgroup level.

When the switch is ON, you can see all the devices in the group selected from the left section as well as the devices in the sub-group. If the Show nested device switch is OFF, you will only see the immediate device provisioned to the selected group.
