## How to Add, Edit, and Delete the Tags to a Device?

  

Tags can make it easier to identify devices in a specific location, types of devices, Wi-Fi, or SSID. Tags can be added to a device in both grid view and list view. You can also click on the â€˜+ ADD/EDI TAG button on the tile or to add or edit tags. If a tag already exists for a device, the drop-down under action choice changes to Edit Tags.

Step1: Click on add tags either in list view or grid view.

  

**Note**: You may need to scroll the right to find the ADD/EDIT tag button in the list view.
