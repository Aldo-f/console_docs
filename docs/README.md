# Welcome

Esper is at heart a technology company that provides Android dedicated device fleet management solutions for enterprises led by APIs, SDKs, and tools for developers. Based in Silicon Valley with supporting teams in Seattle, Esper is currently the only company providing a full stack, API-driven implementation delivering a secure platform for purpose-built Android-based dedicated devices.

# Overview

Welcome to the Esper Console where Android™ developers can build, test, deploy, diagnose, and manage their applications seamlessly and securely to Android-based dedicated devices. Using the console, you will be able to generate API Keys and obtain your Enterprise ID; this enables you to use the Esper APIs either by calling them via REST, with our Esper SDK for Python, or by using our Esper CLI. Additionally, our Esper plugin for Android Studio is available for developers to use, and provides a set of resources to facilitate diagnostics and debugging of applications—whether running in a test lab or deployed in the field.

Esper provides tools that enable Android developers to deliver highly secure solutions to Dedicated Devices, all the while giving them superior flexibility and control over the process. This leads to a better development experience spanning the entire development lifecycle. Furthermore, this lightens the burden on IT, enabling them to focus on more pressing aspects of your product. A rich API set and a variety of open-source SDKs and tools allow you to incorporate device management for your dedicated device apps and dedicated devices.
