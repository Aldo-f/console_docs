## What is Compliance Policy?

  

A Compliance Policy is a set of rules or permissions related to the device configurations that can be applied to devices managed by Esper. The Compliance Policy section enables you to create a policy that sets these parameters.

The Compliance Policy section lists all the policies that have already been created. You have four options with these, indicated by the four icons to the right of each compliance policy listing.

The options are:

-   Duplicate the Policy (two pages icon)- Clicking this icon duplicates an existing compliance policy so you can use it as the basis for a new policy.
    
-   View the Policy (eye icon)- Clicking this icon lets you view an existing compliance policy.
    
-   Edit the Policy (pencil icon)- Clicking this icon lets you make changes to an existing compliance policy. Once the policy has been applied to a device or devices, it cannot be changed and this option will be greyed out.
    
-   Delete the Policy (garbage can icon)- Clicking this icon deletes a policy.
