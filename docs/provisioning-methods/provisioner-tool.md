## How to use the Device Provisioner Tool for Provisioning?

For your ease, we have created a tool for Provisioning which internally uses the ADB (Android Debugging Tool).

This method can be used to provision most Android devices regardless of whether they are -

-   GMS or Non-GMS
    
-   Have a camera or camera-less
    
-   All Android versions including 4.x and 5.x
    
We have made it super user friendly and it takes you through a step by step progress in mini logs seen on the screen.

**Note**:  Admin needs to have an Esper endpoint access, create a device template and have the device physically available and connected to the computer via USB.
