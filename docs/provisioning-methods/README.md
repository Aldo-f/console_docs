# Provisioning methods

## Introduction 

Provisioning is the initial step of enrolling, configuring, and managing an Android device using the Esper platform and associated developer tools. Esper provides several different methods for provisioning Android devices, depending on the capabilities of the device being configured:
- Android for Work, part of Android for Enterprise
- 6 Tap QR Code, part of Android for Enterprise
- The Provisioner Tool
- Seamless Provisioning

Additional provisioning methods may be available including Google Zero-Touch Enrollment, Samsung Knox Mobile Enrollment, IMEI/Serial Number-based, NFC-based, and in some specific cases using a downloaded APK. Please [contact Esper](mailto: support@esper.io) directly to find out if your account qualifies and your device is supported.

To select one of the provisioning methods, or to view detailed steps for that method, hold your mouse over it and the Provision button will appear. Click on the Provision button and detailed steps for the selected method will be displayed
